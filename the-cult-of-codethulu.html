<ol>
<li><p>Since time immemorial, new programmers have appeared in order to bring
change to the world.  They wish for a chance to show the world their
skill and ability.</p>

<p>And for their sins, they get it.</p></li>
<li><p>And then shall the young and inexperienced programmer proclaim loudly
to all who will listen:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Those who came before me were ignorant and foolish.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Codethulu looks on, and says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Well, go and see what you can do.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>The young and inexperienced programmer cries loudly to all who will
listen:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is not a program, but a refuse bin.  At every turn I find
snares to catch the unwary, pits of refuse and stinking entrails,
and the very heart of it seems to be made of mud and sticks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Codethulu looks on, and says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Well, go and see what you can do.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>The young and inexperienced programmer cries loudly to all who will
listen:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I cannot fix this.  It is excrement.  I can rewrite this from
scratch in less time than it will take to make the changes you seek.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Codethulu looks on, and says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Well, go and see what you can do.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>The young and inexperienced programmer cries loudly to all who will
listen:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>World, hear my cry: It would be faster and easier to cast this away
into the deep, and begin afresh.  I understand the way of the true
methods; I will build an elegant tower rising up out of the remains
of this awful rubbish.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Codethulu looks on, and says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Well, go and see what you can do.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Days pass, and seasons change.  Projects fail, or succeed.  The
details may vary, but one thing does not:</p>

<p>On the chosen day, the young and inexperienced programmer realizes
that what he has constructed is simply a different collection of
rubbish, mud and offal than that used by the previous tower.</p></li>
<li><p>Codethulu looks on, and says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now you have become one of us.</p>
</blockquote></li>
