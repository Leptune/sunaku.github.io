troubles, all the while <em>racing</em> to meet the incessant march of time, we
often lose sight of what life really is and what is important within it.</p>

<p>The following videos helped me see the life <em>beyond</em> that race.  First, <a href="#four-reminders">the
four reminders</a> taught me how to <em>distinguish</em> between the life and the
race.  Second, <a href="#six-paramitas">the six paramitas</a> taught me how to <em>develop</em> the life
while still staying in the race.  Finally, <a href="#one-universe">the one universe</a> put the
life, the race, and the self into <em>perspective</em> on the grandest of scales.</p>

<p>Thus I invite you to watch them (they are <em>short</em> videos: not longer than
ten minutes each) at your convenience if you wish to develop yourself
further while keeping the life, the race, the self, and the universe all
in perspective.  :-)</p>

<p>If we are reminded of these four things, and if we really integrate these four
understandings or change our attitudes along these four ways, that alone can
transform our life: we can each become a more responsible/joyful/understanding
person.  Therefore, these four reminders are said to be the first thing we try
to reflect on, if we want to transform ourselves.</p>

<h3 id="life-is-precious">Life is precious<a href="#__life-is-precious__" class="uplink" title="Contents"></a><a href="#life-is-precious" class="permalink" title="Permalink"></a></h3>

<p>How happy/satisfied we are depends on how much we appreciate what we have.
It&rsquo;s not about the problems that we have, but <em>how much we concentrate</em> on the
problems that makes us unhappy, sad, and depressed. Therefore, one of the main
reminders is that <strong>we need to appreciate what we have</strong>.</p>

<p>That is the first principle to transform our life. And if we really work on
this, this alone can also transform our way of feeling.</p>

<h3 id="impermanence">Impermanence<a href="#__impermanence__" class="uplink" title="Contents"></a><a href="#impermanence" class="permalink" title="Permalink"></a></h3>

<p><strong>Everything changes</strong>: there&rsquo;s nothing that doesn&rsquo;t change.  Good times can
change, but bad times can also change.  So even when I go through the most
difficult times, I need to remind myself that there&rsquo;s nothing which doesn&rsquo;t
change.</p>

<p>Everything changes: that&rsquo;s the nature of the life/phenomenon.  The more we see
this clearly, the more we know that <strong>nothing really exists</strong>&hellip; in the same
way all the time, and the more we can <strong>let things be</strong>.</p>

<p>And we also understand that <strong>life is change</strong>: if there&rsquo;s no change, there&rsquo;s
no life/development/living.  Therefore, we need to let things happen:
<strong>there&rsquo;s no use holding on</strong> too much to <em>either</em> negative/bad/hurtful things
that happened to us <em>or</em> good/positive things that might be with us sometimes.</p>

<p>If we really understand this deeply (the impermanence: that everything is
changing) and really integrate it with our life, this could also transform our
life. That&rsquo;s the second reminder.</p>

<h3 id="samsara">Samsara<a href="#__samsara__" class="uplink" title="Contents"></a><a href="#samsara" class="permalink" title="Permalink"></a></h3>

<p>Samsara means that all of us, human beings, have weaknesses/problems and we
need to understand that nobody is perfect.  There&rsquo;s lots of
pain/suffering/problems around us in the world.  When we understand that
deeply, we <strong>don&rsquo;t need to expect everything to be perfect</strong>.</p>

<p>The more we understand that, the more we appreciate the little good things
that people do for us: if we find someone being a little nicer/kinder, we can
appreciate it <em>more</em> because we know that people can be mean, have problems,
and carry lots of negative feelings.  So the more we understand these
weaknesses (the Samsaric state of mind: that there are the
problems/pain/weaknesses in people), the more we can understand <strong>how to
appreciate</strong> the positive things.</p>

<p>Also, if people do negative things, we can <em>still</em> be compassionate/forgiving
to them because of the Samsaric way of being <em>we all</em> have (with all the
negative emotions/ignorance/selfishness). We all have
greed/aggression/ignorance and that allow us to feel more compassionate to
people, even those who are doing not-so-positive things.</p>

<p>The more we understand Samsara, the more we <strong>feel at ease living with other
people</strong> because we don&rsquo;t expect too much from everybody and <em>also</em> because we
don&rsquo;t expect too much from ourselves.  This is the third reminder.</p>

<h3 id="karma">Karma<a href="#__karma__" class="uplink" title="Contents"></a><a href="#karma" class="permalink" title="Permalink"></a></h3>

<p>Everything has causes/conditions and happens interdependently/relatively: what
I am now is because of my past and what I will be in the future is because of
my present so <strong>my future is, in a way, in my hands</strong>.  Therefore, I have to
take responsibility for myself and think/act in a proper/careful way because
<strong>how I act with my body, speech, and mind</strong> is very important not only for my
own future but also because it affects the world/people around me.</p>
